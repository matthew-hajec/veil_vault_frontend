Supports client-side decryption and encryption of files using a password. This is achieved using the Web Crypto API and the AES-GCM encryption algorithm with the PBKDF2 key derivation function. (More details in the [ENC0](enc0.md) document.)

Supports direct downloads from object storage providers via presigned S3-style URLs.
